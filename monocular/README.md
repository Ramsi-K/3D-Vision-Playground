## Tasks

* Monocular Depth Estimation with HuggingFace Transformers. Model 1: Transformer Based DPT ; Model 2: Diffusion Based Marigold.

## Dataset

The [SUN RGB-D](https://colab.research.google.com/corgiredirector?site=https%3A%2F%2Frgbd.cs.princeton.edu%2F) dataset contains 10,335 RGB-D images, each of which has a corresponding RGB image, depth image, and camera intrinsics. It contains images from the NYU depth v2, Berkeley B3DO, and SUN3D datasets. SUN RGB-D is one of the most popular datasets for monocular depth estimation and semantic segmentation tasks!
